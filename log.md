# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 21 2017 (Not exactly going as per plan)
**Notes**: 100-days-of-code not going as planned. Issues included:
  1. Not able to work after day job.
  2. Not able to push the changes made.
  3. Not able to add entries to logs
  4. Not able to find the entusiasm :O
  
**Today's Progress**: (Including couple of prev progress as well)
  1. FLOCK-LIVE-HELP: Made a project `flock-live-help` which helps user to integrate VS Code with FLOCK (flock.co). User can ask for questions directly from IDE which is shared on flock (it's a team communication platform). And reply on the channel is propagated back to IDE. Finished a POC, made a demo video and made submission to flockathon.
  2. ML-EXPERIMENTS: Tested other classifiers like `KNN`, `ADABOOST`, `RANDOMFOREST`.
  3. CSRF Protector PHP: Triaged and tested couple of issues in CSRF Protector PHP

**Thoughts:** 
  1. FLOCK-LIVE-HELP: Task was to port a previous experiment with SLACK and included mostly API changes only.
  2. ML-EXPERMIENTS: Got decent accuracy (79% - best so far) with RandomForest Ensemble Classifier.
  3. CSRF Protector PHP: Looking forward to fix the issues posted by users, complete milestone and push a new release to library.

### Day 0: January 16 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started experimenting with machine learning models using python & sklearn.
First problem I'm trying to solve is to be able to classify an issue on Github Repository as bug or enhancement. For this I scraped more than 100,000 issues from Github and created a dataset.
I tried with Gaussian Naive Bayes today and could get an accuracy around 68% which is not very good.

**Thoughts:** Realised need to brush up my python skills. Also need to test better models for text classification. Also may be take a step back and have a look at feature selection as well.
