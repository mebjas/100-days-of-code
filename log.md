# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 16 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started experimenting with machine learning models using python & sklearn.
First problem I'm trying to solve is to be able to classify an issue on Github Repository as bug or enhancement. For this I scraped more than 100,000 issues from Github and created a dataset.
I tried with Gaussian Naive Bayes today and could get an accuracy around 68% which is not very good.

**Thoughts:** Realised need to brush up my python skills. Also need to test better models for text classification. Also may be take a step back and have a look at feature selection as well.
